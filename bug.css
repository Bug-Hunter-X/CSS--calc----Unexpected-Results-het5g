The CSS property `calc()` can sometimes produce unexpected results if you don't fully understand its order of operations. For example, `width: calc(100% - 10px);` might not work as expected if the parent element's width is not explicitly defined or calculated properly.  Another common mistake is using `calc()` with units inconsistently.  You can't mix percentages and `em` units directly; you need to convert everything to a common unit.
